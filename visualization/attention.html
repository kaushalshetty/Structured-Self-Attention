horribly fails in a number of areas 1 acting mediocre at best but it is watchable no worse than your average uk sitcom though for a movie one expects a little better especially with a score of over 7 2 music the music used is simply horrible it distracts and it is annoying especially the pub music and the music which plays in the <UNK> apartment 3 storyline this is a big joke there are gaping plot holes everywhere and even the obligatory love story is so unrealistic that it's almost funny furthermore without going into any detail i can safely say that the ending is absurd and one of the worst pieces of acting and storyline of the year 4 camera work at times camera positions and views are distracting and serve absolutely no purpose to the story br br i'm a bit of a movie fanatic and watch

boiled action star i think not br br with the cheesy almost awkward acting low budget fx and zany over the top action set pieces it all kinda evoked that old tv show sledge hammer for me hilarious br

<UNK> of a voice she has she's no julia roberts but yet she comes across on screen as though she believes herself to be on the same playing field well she's not even in the same stadium sure she is a very sexy lady however that isn't going to carry a film and it certainly doesn't carry this one with anybody else cast in her role for this film it would have been excellent especially if it was cast with someone who could lend more credibility to the character br br having said all that this film is visually stunning the colors are fabulous and the story line isn't half bad in a b movie kind of

in fact ranger jake actually encouraged tiny to do both him and the bikers in by showing him how incompetent he was in trying to save them the fact that ranger jake was successful wasn't because he

with some of its best moments br br if you love danielle steel you will love this film if you love archetypal romance you will love this film i did not i was able to sit through it but it was close","only films i've seen where i can almost say that simply nothing happens i felt as though i watched a drug dealing middle class couple with child walk around eat smoke converse excuse me swear through most of the film and i don't believe i'm missing the point i think this film was well directed well acted although the husband's performance was rather wooden and the constant feeling of impending doom around every corner certainly kept the viewer involved but when the dust <UNK> your left with zero just a boat load of fade outs i didn't want car chases gun violence beatings etc in fact i'm sick of violence but my goodness let's at least get a bit deeper into all these characters let's get to know each of these corrupt officers a little better not just show <UNK> shots of them

unintelligible irish <UNK> needs a little <UNK> on the other hand cliff curtis <UNK> and as sarah's son boy were well rounded and believable br br the last 20 minutes of river queen came across as particularly compressed and rushed it seemed as if they decided they had to tie up all the loose ends before 120 minutes were up e g how on earth did know how to find sarah and doyle no explanation and very unsatisfying br br i did go to this movie with an open mind i hadn't read or heard anything much apart from its troubled production what i experienced was a mish mash of new zealand history beautifully photographed but ultimately disappointing","a horror movie as such but rather a tragic story of a family's breakdown as well as an honest look at a character's mental illness and i <UNK> to add that fans of <UNK> cinema are going to love this film br br that aside the cinematography in a tale of two sisters is incredible and visually this is one of the most beautiful films i've seen this side of wong kar <UNK> <UNK> the performances are also fantastic without exception and i expect to see more of the four lead actors in the future not to mention the music but then east asian films without a great soundtrack seem to be few and far between these days br br it's very likely that some people will look past the finer artistic points of a tale of two sisters and simply dismiss it as yet another asian horror film oblivious to its aesthetic beauty and honest <UNK> approach but then each to their own if you can ignore some of the film's <UNK> aspects and simply take it for

be the finest short story in the english language in beautifully spare language it tells of the realization of gabriel conroy that his life and the lives of so many around him are controlled by memories of the dead even his own wife of many years loved a man now dead more than him br br to bring such a short story to the cinema was always going to be tricky john huston did a magnificent job he never gave in to temptation to play it up or use fancy technique to expand on the story it is simple and true with outstanding acting the only slight miss step is the use of music to accompany the devastating final soliloquy br br its rare indeed for a movie version of a literary masterpiece to be itself a masterpiece but i think its fair to use this term for this movie its not a bravura piece of film making but it is simple and pure i always think of <UNK> movies when i think of the dead its at that level of purity and simplicity and deep wisdom","<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>

yeah me too and you know what it was funny br br by no means is this a good movie it's absolutely a waste of time but it's a good waste of time you may still think it's crap and fair enough but i thought it was a really funny slapstick comedy i didn't like a couple of bits like when the fish got hit by the car but apart from that i thought it was good i loved sitting there and picking out all the famous australian faces <UNK> garry mcdonald etc br br so if you like to waste your time watch this movie otherwise see a drama or something","were working on something worthwhile or did they cry

sense in the events on screen i suppose when a life drama needs a meteor or what is more something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content that's a really bad sign the characters are not much better than a story despite all his troubles young mickey by no means is not a likable character but it's clearly was somehow we were supposed to care about him and even feel strong sympathy to him it doesn't work the same thing with other characters they are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character although he wasn't the main character as the only bright spot towards the end of the movie i still had a strong hope that there is something behind of all that <UNK> and absurdity unfortunately even if the writer of the story had such intentions and i'm sure he had in the film they are hidden and practically under such a weird script br br grade 3 out of 10 those of you who are interested in seeing mike myers as a drama actor can watch pete's meteor for that

jerry in mind nobody acts that way all the time and the performance comes off as hopelessly <UNK> <UNK> lewis to a <UNK> caricature the nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of sheer over acting br br the author of the book this is based on nick is a good writer who has written several fine musical bios i particularly liked dino on dean martin in the books gives us a full human being both separate from and involved in the biz <UNK> acting seems to imply that jerry never acted like a human being if people were like this no one would bother to hang around them as cartoons go it is

proved to be very talented at writing and directing as well as acting br br the pacing of the movie is done extremely well i am hard pressed to think of a point where it drags br br what amazes me is that it didn't get an oscar or any real recognition when it came out it is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not who he used to be and probably will never

called it pretentious which is an understatement is pseudo intellectual trash designed to be anti hollywood so that the cannes judges could assert their independence from the oscars br br the imdb reviewer states unlike hollywood movies which usually force the audience into overdrive this forces the audience to slow down and look at some of life's tiniest and most mundane features in great detail you would have to be catatonic to stare at some of these images this long and move as slowly at these characters this isn't real life unless you are heavily <UNK> br br finally i felt that portrayal was a sad rip off of peter sellers' masterful gardner he uses the same facial expressions and <UNK> he even gardens in many respects there are parallels between these two movies the main

to gas the enemy and chaplin's foray into enemy territory dressed as a tree br br by this stage in this career the great man had become so immersed in filmic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves doubtless this was not the case but still it gives as convincingly realistic view of life at the front as i can remember albeit from an ironically humorous perspective

acting the directing or even the gore i will go with choices a and b both were terrible it was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with shifty eyes as they talk to one person but i
